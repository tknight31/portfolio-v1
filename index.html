        <span class="divider"></span>
        <p>I'm a fourth year student at Northeastern University in Boston studying computer science and interaction design. I have experience developing and designing software for the web, from simple landing pages to progressive web applications. I strive to create software that not only functions efficiently under the hood, but also provides intuitive, pixel-perfect user experiences. I love learning new and better ways to create seamless user experiences with clean, efficient, and scalable code. I consider work an ongoing education, and I'm always looking for opportunities to work with those who are willing to share their knowledge as much as I want to learn. At the end of the day, my primary goal is to create something beautiful with people that bring out the best in me.</p>
